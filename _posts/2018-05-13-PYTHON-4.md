    <td>I feel like I have worked very well, I had finished the date and time section and got through half way the other section in the lesson. Today, the strategies I had used to develop my learning in Python was to stay focus and ask for help on questions I had struggled on. I also helped other people to boost my learning on the topic they were doing on Python. This lesson I was going through the different sections very quickly and I tried to be as independent as I could possibly be. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Nothing had limited my learning. What I have to focus on is to accept mistakes and try and sort them out myself to accelerate my learning of Python. I should try not to use the solution option if I cannot figure out what the answer of the question is.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have to change the fact that I always use the solution option, which means that it gives the answer to the question if you get the question repeatedly wrong, and give the question another try with a new mindset. If I do use this option I should read through it fastidiously so I can understand where I have gone wrong. This will also be on how I improve my learning.</td>
