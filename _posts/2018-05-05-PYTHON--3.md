    <td>Today, I think that I have learnt extremely well. I had just about completed the work in the lesson and through it quite rapidly. I had to just complete one small part at home but I focused well. The strategies that were effective were to be independant and not talk to anyone so you are able you concentrate on the task given. </td>
