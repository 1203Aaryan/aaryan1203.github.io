  <tr>
    <td>I think that I had learnt pretty well in the lesson, for instance, I had completed Conditionals and Control Flow and I had moved onto PygLatin. PygLatin is a language game where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay" at the end too. For instance, “Python” becomes “ythonpay”. The strategies effective were: to stay focus on the task given and ask for help if necessary.</td>

    <td>Nothing had limited my learning, the habits I need to work on are not to give up so easily and use the solution button and not ask for too much help as that can sometimes give away the answer.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact, for next time, that I always ask for help if I do not understand something and not to use the solution button so quickly. I should attempt the question a few more times before giving up. If I end up using the solution button, I should read what it says so I know what to do for next time.</td>
