  <tr>
    <td>I think that I had learnt pretty well, the strategies that were effective was to work with a steady pace and accurately. I had to stay head down, focusing on the task at hand. In the lesson, I managed to complete the whole topic called functions and then I had started on "lists and dictionaries" which applies the same rules as the topic function does. Somethings in Python can get quite tricky and I had found the functions topic difficult therefore I had to use the solution button more often than I needed to. </td>

    <td>Nothing had limited my learning, habits I need to improve on is to learn from my mistakes and if and when I use the solutions button, I need to learn from where the computer had got the information from. I also should read the information already given to get the gist as to what the computer wants me to do.</td>

    <td>I will find a way, and change the fact my badges appear at the top rather that the bottom; I will need to reformat my entire layout so that I will be able to sort out the badge problem. I should also limit using the solutions button and learn from that.</td>
