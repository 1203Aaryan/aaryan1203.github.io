    <td>I think that I had learnt pretty well this lesson, I had completed the topic Functions, in which you had define a syntax and argue (within the code). It started of easy at first but gradually got a lot difficult and I had to use the solution button a few times. I had learnt from the solutions though which had helped me understand on where I had gone wrong. Strategies effective were to stay focused. I started the topic "Taking a Vacation".</td>
